* BST Traversals
* in_order(self): will return a generator that will return the values in the tree using in-order traversal, one at a time.

* pre_order(self): will return a generator that will return the values in the tree using pre-order traversal, one at a time.

* post_order(self): will return a generator that will return the values in the tree using post_order traversal, one at a time.

* breadth_first(self): will return a generator that will return the values in the tree using breadth-first traversal, one at a time.


* Sorting Algorithms
* insertion_sort(initial_list): will return a new list that is ordered using insertion sort
* merge_sort(initial_list): will return a new list that is ordered using merge sort
* quick_sort(initial_list): will return a new list that is ordered using quick sort. Pivot is chosen using subdivision
* radix_sort(initial_list): will return a new list that is ordered using radix_sort. Only works for positive integers
